# onyx-engine
A simple extension for pygame that abstracts many common usage patterns.

[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) was part of my first introduction to
programming back when I was in middle school. It was remarkably easy to get
started with, and I keep coming back to it whenever I need to do anything
graphical. It turns out a lot of my pygame programs look really similar. This
library is my attempt at abstracting many of my usage patterns, while still
providing much of the flexibility that pygame is so great at.

Onyx is not attempting to cover up every pygame feature or type, but instead
is designed to be used alongside it. Check out the examples directory to see
what intended use looks like.

At this point, this is purely driven by my curiosity, so updates may be
sporadic. But I am hoping that this will result in something at least somewhat
useful!
